I care about a healthy lifestyle, so I cook for almost every meal. baking cookies and cakes make me really happy. Honestly, I enjoy cooking more than eating :) I lift weights every other day to stay fit. Following and listening to Huberman's podcast has helped me a lot in having a healthy lifestyle. The second most important hobby of mine is watching movies and TV series. I like watching popular TV shows. But I love artistic movies and reading their critics or joining movie criticism sessions. I can watch movies with mythological stories like Mother anti crist over and over again like I used to swim and take part in swimming competitions during primary and high school but now I just swim in summers and for recreation :) This is a kind of side effect of having a job like programming:))",
